description: There are a lot rich ingredients here, but it's Alfredo, so it's supposed to be decadent.
ingredients:
  - 3/4 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, coated with olive oil, salt, and pepper
  - 5 - 10 oz spinach.  If frozen, thaw and drain.
  - 6 oz. fettucine, linguine, angel hair or similar pasta
  - 2 tbsp. butter
  - 1 cup parmesan, grated
  - 3/4 cup heavy cream
  - 2 tbsp. sour cream
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
instructions: >-
  1. If the spinach is frozen, thaw and drain it.  If not, place it in a microwave safe dish with 1 tbsp. water and nuke it for a minute or until wilted.
  2. Preheat oven to 400.  When preheated, turn broiler to high. 
  3. Begin boiling 2-3 quarts of salted water. 
  4. Place chicken 6 inches from broiler.
  5. Broil 5-6 minutes per side.  Chicken should be finished a few minutes prior to pasta, so it can rest on a cutting board. 
  6. When the water's boiling, cook pasta according to package directions. 
  7. Heat butter over medium-low heat in a small sauce pan.
  8. When butter is melted, saute garlic for 1-2 minutes. 
  9. Set heat to low.  Mix in sour cream, cream, and parmesan until heated through.
  10. When pasta and chicken are done, slice chicken cross-wise in 1/4 slices.  Mix spinach, alfredo sauce, and pasta.  Top with chicken.
