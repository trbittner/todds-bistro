description: "This combines some ready made ingredients, like _Frank's Hot Sauce_ and a pre-made pizza crust, with homemade blue cheese dressing."
ingredients:
  - A pre-made pizza crust.  I use _Stonefire Grill_, but anything will do.
  - 2 tbsp. hot sauce
  - 1 tbsp. butter
  - 1 tbsp. olive oil
  - 1/2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts
  - 1/4 cup sour cream
  - 2 oz. blue cheese
  - 1 cup shredded mozzarella
  - Salt and pepper to taste.
instructions: 
  - 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  - 2. Coat chicken breasts with olive oil, salt and pepper.
  - 3. When the oven is pre-heated, turn the broiler to high, and cook chicken breasts 6 inches from the heat source for about 5-6 minutes per side.
  - 4. While the chicken is cooking, mash the sour cream, blue cheese, salt, and pepper together.
  - 5. When the chicken is finished cooking, increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees.  Let the chicken rest 1-2 minutes.
  - 6. Melt the butter in microwave and combine with the hot sauce.
  - 7. Slice the chicken crosswise into 1/4 inch slices.  Coat with the butter and hot sauce.
  - 8. Spread the blue cheese mixture on the pizza crust.  Top with the chicken mixture.  Finish with mozzarella.
  - 9. Bake for 12 minutes.
